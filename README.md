# Expreter

This is an interpreter, written in Scala, for the fictional programming language "Exp". 

I'm very proud of this piece of software, because it was a lot of work and got me so deep into functional programming. 

Altough Scala combines the power of procedural and functional programming, I tried to stay as much as I could on the functional side. And I have to admit, Scala provides a very fashionable way to do so !

I implemented the ExpInterpreter while attending a course at University of Technology Graz.
